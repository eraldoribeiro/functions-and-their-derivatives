Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the  reference  and  sensed  images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature ( area-based  and  feature-based ) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure:  feature detection ,  feature matching ,  mapping function design , and  image transformation and resampling . Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

defined, and it is shown how to construct an arbitrarily large number of
independent, algebraic combinations of Zernike moments that are
invariant to image translation, orientation, and size. This approach is
contrasted with the usual method of moments. The general problem of
two-dimensional pattern recognition and three-dimensional object
recognition is discussed within this framework. A unique reconstruction
of an image in either real space or Fourier space is given in terms of a
finite number of moments. Examples of applications of the method are
given. A coding scheme for image storage and retrieval is discussed.},

computer vision. Unfortunately, traditional image registration
techniques tend to be costly. We present a new image
registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity
gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of
Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is faster because
it examines far fewer potential matches between the images
than existing techniques. Furthermore, this registration
technique can be generalized to...},

@inproceedings{saad_ali_2007CVPR_flow,
    abstract = {This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian Particle Dynamics is used for the segmentation of high density crowd flows and detection of flow instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a Flow Map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green Deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time. The experiments are conducted on a challenging set of videos taken from Google Video and a National Geographic documentary.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we address the problem of detecting pedestrians in
	crowded real-world scenes with severe overlaps. Our basic premise
	is that this problem is too difficult for any type of model or feature
	alone. Instead, we present a novel algorithm that integrates evidence
	in multiple iterations and from different sources. The core part
	of our method is the combination of local and global cues via a probabilistic
	top-down segmentation. Altogether, this approach allows to examine
	and compare object hypotheses with high precision down to the pixel
	level. Qualitative and quantitative results on a large data set confirm
	that our method is able to reliably detect pedestrians in crowded
	scenes, even when they overlap and partially occlude each other.
	In addition, the flexible nature of our approach allows it to operate
	on very small training sets.},

@article{Yu_PAMI2008,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a general guideline to find a better distance measure for similarity estimation based on statistical analysis of distribution models and distance functions. A new set of distance measures are derived from the harmonic distance, the geometric distance, and their generalized variants according to the maximum likelihood theory. These measures can provide a more accurate feature model than the classical euclidean and Manhattan distances. We also find that the feature elements are often from heterogeneous sources that may have different influence on similarity estimation. Therefore, the assumption of single isotropic distribution model is often inappropriate. To alleviate this problem, we use a boosted distance measure framework that finds multiple distance measures, which fit the distribution of selected feature elements best for accurate similarity estimation. The new distance measures for similarity estimation are tested on two applications: stereo matching and motion tracking in video sequences. The performance of boosted distance measure is further evaluated on several benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and two image retrieval applications. In all the experiments, robust results are obtained based on the proposed methods.},
